2021-05-11 many small changes made over the past few days. The update function does work and prints an ok on teh webpage, working on making teh update complete page look nicer. minor changes through out the past few days to fix formating and add vairables to allwo for better control of the webpage. option built in for setting device name, requires 2 lines but specific to platform.io at this moment.

2021-05-09 This is a very early setup. right now the webpage works, still need to add data to the webpage to signify esp8266 or esp32 along with device id. then adding in support for firmware update.
